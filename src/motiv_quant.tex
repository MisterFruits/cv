Dear head of QuantStack, Sylvain Corlay,

Your advertisement for a Software Engineer in Python\&C++ and Package
management position has captured my interest. I believe I would be an excellent
fit for this job with regard of my experience as software developer and in the
scientific computing field. Some key skills you will find relevant include:

 - proficient in developing Python code as well as manipulating C++ code from my
current position.
 - used to working with git and commonly implemented workflows (issue/merge
request/CI)
 - committed in automating most recurrent processes with Continuous Integration
tools
 - comfortable with scientific computing, from my current position and education
 - as an engineer from the support team, I'm used to detail user requests and
elaborate related solution.


In my current position at CINES, I am involved in the installation and deployment
of hundreds of softwares on the tier 1 HPC cluster Occigen. I am working with
variety of build tools and I am involved in the automation and industrialisation
of whole process.

I strongly believe in public sciences and free software through wide resources and
knowledge sharing. I have a limited experience in the field of OpenSource and I
would be glad to improve it. Still, my understanding of this world is quite good
and I am used to submitting bug reports and feature requests using Github and Gitlab.
You can find an example of a contribution of mine to the code of EasyBuild, a
referenced HPC package manager written with python:
\href{https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/2457}
{$\hookrightarrow$ https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework/pull/2457}

I'm looking for a dynamic team working with modern IT technology and
methodologies where my passionate and pragmatic personality could bloom.

I would welcome the opportunity to meet you for in in-depth interview to discuss
how we could work together.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely
Victor Cameo Ponz
